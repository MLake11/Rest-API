<h1>Building a Rest API with node.js, Visual Studio Code, and Postman</h1>


<h2>Project Overview</h2>
In this project, I made an outline of what I wanted to do. I created a small database with clients and their medical records. Then, I was able to get the patient's record using the API. After that, I created a new patient, update all the patient's phone numbers, and ultimately delete all the records of the patients. This was my first time building a Rest API and I'm very proud of the outcome.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Node.js</b> 
- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>
- <b>Postman</b>

<br />
<br />
Next, I downloaded a program called Postman <br/>

<br />
<br />
Lastly, I downloaded node.js <br/>

<br />
My first plan of action was to build the outline of the API

<br />
<br />
After that, I created a database with 2 people and their information <br/>

<br />
<br />
Shortly after, I was able to add a new person to the database

<br />
<br />
Changed the phone numbers of one of the patients from 425-555-5555 to 425-777-7890

<br />
To end this lab, I went through and deleted all of the patients and their information from the database
